# GNN-Accelerated FPGA Routing
Use a GNN as the heuristic generator for pathfinder VPR algorithm

## Modified VPR
VTR to VPR is an Open Source tool. We modify it in order to both collect data for training and input inferenced history costs. 

## PyTorch & Pytorch Geometric
We use PyTorch running a GNN that uses SAGE and TAG Convolutional layers from the papers here:
